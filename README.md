## Overview
The Advance Learner Assistance System (ALAS) architecture is composed by a set of modules, the current GitHub repository contains scipts used by the Machine Learning module. The repository in question is organized as a set of milestones that led to the final model, which predicted a 3-level mental fatigue with a 92.25% accuracy using EEG features.

The raw data used was drawn from the following IEEE databse: [EEG and Empatica E4 Signals - Five Minute P300 Test and FAS Scores](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/eeg-and-empatica-e4-signals-five-minute-p300-test-and-fas-scores), which obtained EEG signals and related it to mental fatigue via the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS).

Although the scripts can be visualized via the folders, the following ordered list contains a hyperlink to each module's milestone report already rendered into html:
